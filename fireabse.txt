The simpler approach would be to create a Firebase instance with the Firebase class and then import the instance (or class) in every React component where itâ€™s needed, but that is not a good approach for two reasons:

It will be more difficult to test our React components.
Firebase should only be initialized once in our application (singleton) and by exposing the Firebase class to every React component, we could end up with multiple Firebase instances by mistake.
